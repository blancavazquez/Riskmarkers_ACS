-- Title: Identificaci√≥n of STEMI patients.
-- Notes: Extraction conditions are:
--        1) Priority of the diagnosis must be "1" (using seq_num fields from diagnoses_icd table)
-- Once extracted each set of data, join them in a csv.file
-- The important point of this query is to extract the patients IDS.
